!! DESCRIPTION: 
  This software (ExoCAM) contains system files, source code files, 
  initial conditions files, namelists, and documentations needed to adapt the 
  NCAR Community Earth System Model 1.2.1 for planetary/exoplanetary
  applications. The files provided do not run standalone.  This is a library 
  of files to be used with publicly available distribution of CESM version 1.2.1.  
  CESM is freely available at http://www.cesm.ucar.edu/models/current.html

  It is best to think of ExoCAM as a patch to CESM1.2.1!!
  Familiarity with checking out, building, and running CESM 1.2.1 is assumed.  
  Please refer to the publicly available CESM userâ€™s guide for details.  
  http://www.cesm.ucar.edu/models/cesm1.2/cesm/doc/usersguide/ug.pdf

  ExoCAM is intended to be run with ExoRT, a correlated-k radiative transfer package 
  for 3-D climate models available at https://github.com/storyofthewolf/ExoRT. 
  ExoRT was separated from ExoCAM in order to faciliate a standalone 1D
  off-line version of ExoRT, which could more easily be updated and tested.

  ExoCAM supports several standard "configs" along with options to change
  planet parameters, and atmospheric compostions.
  General instructions and descriptions of supported planet modifications is
  found here ../ExoCAM/cesm1.2.1/instructions
  Specific instructions for configs  are located in individual config directories located at 
  ../ExoCAM/cesm1.2.1/configs/*/README.  

  Also refer to the CESM usersguide listed above.

!! DISCLAIMER:
  This is a research grade code, that is constantly evolving.  There are no
  gaurantees of mercantibility,  warrantability, scientific accuracy, or nobel
  prize winning potential.  I make mistakes just like everyone else.   Not all 
  functionalties are supported, and sometimes things break.  
  Please see also the LICENSE.

!! SUPPORT:
  This is research grade code(!), and the model support and development team is
  limited to pretty much just me (eric.wolf@colorado.edu).  While I do my
  best to  keep the code coherent, usable, and documented, while fixing bugs,
  developing new features, addressing user questions, and trying to do my own
  science on the side, it is impossible for me to address all concerns and
  contigencies.  I encourage users to experiment different ways to implement,
  configure, and use ExoCAM and ExoRT with CESM1.2.1.   

  With that said, if you are planning to use this code, I encourage you to
  reach out to me to ensure that your particular application is possible with
  the code as is, and that there are no gotchas or hidden idiosyncracies.  I
  also encourage you to report bugs found in the code. Note, many common
  troubleshoots needed in CESM can be solved by looking here
  https://bb.cgd.ucar.edu/cesm/.  This site is a wealth on information.   

!! CITING:
  If you use ExoCAM in your work, please footnote to where the model is
  available.  I.e. my Github pages.
  https://github.com/storyofthewolf/ExoCAM
  https://github.com/storyofthewolf/ExoRT
  If you are feeling generous, can cite a paper or two of mine from the list.

!! MODEL OUTPUTS:
  I encourage all users to make their 3D model output files publicly available
  when appropriate.  Many academic journals are now requiring this.  I store
  model outputs from my published work at: https://archive.org/details/@eric_t_wolf
  and also on zenodo, or made available upon request.
