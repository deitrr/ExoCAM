QuickStart Guide :: carma haze aerosol add on
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
description:        carma aerosol model add-on
physics:            cam4
surface type:       user selected
dynamical core:     user selected
radiation scheme:   src.cam.n68equiv

NOTES: These files provide a very basic linkage between ExoCAM, ExoRT, and
CARMA. Use at your own risk.  CARMA is complicated in its own right.  
Limited support available from me.

In the future, new CARMA cloud/aerosol "models" should be saved and linked via
-carma $exoModel, and the radiation module should be remade such that the same
version is used with or without carma. 

For now, we piggy back off of the "meteor_smoke" CARMA model, and we utilize a
seperate radiation build.

Instructions:
make sure that your version of CESM1.2.1/CARMA has the fractal aggregrate
add-ons to the CARMA directorty, copy and unzip base.tar into
../cesm1_2_1/models/atm/cam/src/physics/carma

 Begin by creating a basic aquaplanet or landplanet case (i.e cam_aqua_fv, cam_land_fv)
In addition to the build instructions for these configurations ...
Copy src.cam folder files into /$CASENAME/SourceMods/src.cam, in addition to other
SourceMods files from the base config (i.e. cam_aqua_fv, cam_land_fv,etc)
These provide a linkage with ExoRT, bypassing the native framework for link with CAMRT and RRTMG.   

A basic template for a generic fractal haze carma model is included.

xmlchange CAM_CONFIG_OPTS="-phys cam4 -nlev 55 -usr_src $PATH/ExoRT/3dmodels/src.cam.n68equiv.haze -carma meteor_smoke -nadv 43"
This loads basic smoke model, but this is overwritten by SourceMods files for generic fractal haze
	-nadv = number of advected constituents = (H2O water, H2O ice, H2O liquid, + N CARMA bins)
	-nlev = number of vertical levels (need higher model top for stratospheric haze
	-build with n68equiv.haze ExoRT, it is the only currently supported with carma link
