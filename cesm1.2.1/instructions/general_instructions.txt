== general instructions for running ExoCAM and ExoRT ==
== Author: Wolf, E.T.

This document provides instructions for building and running ExoCAM and
ExoRT.  Here, system  installations are supported for...
  University of Washington's  Hyak supercomputer
  University of Colorado's Summit supuercomputer
  NASA's, Discover supercomputer
  For other machines, follow NCAR's instructions for "userdefined" machines.  

  Note#1: Installation of the base model, CESM, on each machine poses individual
  challenges specific to each system.  These nuances are a "normal"
  aggravation of running 3D models, and fall outside the scope of this document.

  Note#2:  CESM version 1.2.1 is mutli-configurable. A variety of physics
  packages, dynamical cores, chemistry packages, and namelist options can be
  experimented with that beyond the setups listed here.  However,
  cross-configuration compatabilities are not guaranteed.   

NOTE:  quickstart guides are given in 
../ExoCAM/cesm1.2.1/configs/$model_config/README


STEP 0: Pre-Requistites
 
  Familiarity and relative competence with checking out, building and running the
  National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Community Earth System Model
  (CESM)is assumed.  Please refer to their provided support documents for help,
  web-addresses given below.  Before beginning with ExoCAM and ExoRT, it is
  advisable to try building and running a standard supported case to familiarize
  yourself with the process.

STEP 1: Checkout ExoCAM and ExoRT Github packages

  Go to your favorite directory and issue commands ...
  git clone https://github.com/storyofthewolf/ExoRT.git
  git clone https://github.com/storyofthewolf/ExoCAM.git

  On supported machines, you can use existing distributions maintained by
  Wolf, E.T., found at the following locations...

  Discover: /gpfsm/dnb53/etwolf/models/ExoRT, /gpfsm/dnb53/etwolf/models/ExoCAM
  Hyak: /suppscr/vsm/gscratch/wolfet/ExoRT, /suppscr/vsm/gscratch/wolfet/ExoCAM
  Summit:  /projects/wolfet/models/ExoRT, /projects/wolfet/models/ExoCAM


STEP 2:  Place new system files into CESM.

  copy the following files from ../ExoCAM/cesm1.2.1/ccsm_utils_files
  to the appropriate location within the CESM model

  ../cesm1_2_1/scripts/ccsm_utils/Machines/mkbatch.$machine_name
  ../cesm1_2_1/scripts/ccsm_utils/Machines/env_mach_specific.$machine_name
  ../cesm1_2_1/scripts/ccsm_utils/Machines/config_compilers.xml
  ../cesm1_2_1/scripts/ccsm_utils/Machines/config_machines.xml
  ../cesm1_2_1/scripts/ccsm_utils/Case.template/config_compsets.xml
  ../cesm1_2_1/models/atm/cam/bld/namelist_files/namelist_definition.xml
  ../cesm1_2_1/models/ocn/docn/bld/namelist_files/namelist_definition_docn.xml


STEP 3:  Create a new case

  Create a new case.  Refer to ../ExoCAM/cesm1.2.1/configs/README and 
  also README files in configs/* directories for build configurations and 
  specific instructions.  For an example, for an aquaplanet model with the FV
  dynamical core, go to ../cesm1_2_1/scripts/, and issue command

  create_newcase -case $my_aquaplanet_case -res f45_f45 -mach hyak -compset E2000C4AQI


STEP 4:  Link ExoRT radiative transfer model and set configure options

  Go to your case directory ($CASEROOT, in NCAR parlance)
  issue command...

  xmlchange CAM_CONFIG_OPTS="-nlev 40 -phys cam4 -usr_src $EXORT_PATH/ExoRT/3dmodels/src.cam.n******"
  
  Where $EXORT_PATH is the path to where your ExoRT has been checked out, 
  and "n******" represents the spectra you want to use (e.g., replace with "n68equiv"). 
  Radiative transfer models, ready for linking with CESM in 3D are located at
  ../ExoRT/3dmodels 

  NOTE: If you plan on making changes to the radiation model, I would suggest making
  a duplicate copy somewhere else on your machine.

  option -nlev = number of vertical levels
  option -phys is the physics package

  By default, above setting -phys cam4 builds with the Rasch & Kristjansson "RK"
  cloud scheme.  You can also build the model using the more advanced Morrison
  and Gettleman "MG" cloud scheme from cam5 by amending the xmlchange
  CAM_CONFIG_OPTS command with...

  "-chem none -microphys mg1"
 
  and by uncommenting the appropriate options in the user_nl_cam namelist file. 
  

STEP 5:  Copy SourceMods and namelist files to your case

  Copy SourceMods directory from ../ExoCAM/cesm1.2.1/configs/$model_config to
  your case directory ($CASEROOT)

  Copy namelist files from ../ExoCAM/cesm1.2.1/configs/$model_config/namelist_files/* to
  your case directory ($CASEROOT)

  open the namelist files (user_*) and change the paths to initial files to
  match the location of your ExoCAM distribution.

  Also, open SourceMods/src.share/exoplanet_mod.F90 and edit the path of 
  'exo_solar_file' to match the ExoRT path.

  Edit or verify the correct path for exort_rootdir in the file 
  ExoRT/3dmodels/src.cam.n******/sys_rootdir.F90

  Optional: if you wish to make modifications to the radiative transfer
  modules, copy the RT folder $EXORT_PATH/ExoRT/3dmodels/src.cam.n****** into your
  $CASEROOT/SourceMods directory, and change -usr_src config opt approriately.


STEP 6:  Building and running

  Within $CASEROOT directory, issue command cesm_setup to setup the model.
  Within $CASEROOT directory, issue comment $CASE.build to build the model.
  Within $CASEROOT directory, issue command $CASE.run to run the model.
