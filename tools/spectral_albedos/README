Ice spectra are taken from Shields et al., 2013
Spectra for snow, blue marine ice and 50% mixture between snow and blue marine ice is included. 
Snow corresponds to the condensation of water vapor from the atmosphere, blue marine ice forms from the freezing of liquid water and exhibits bubbles and cracks due to thermal stress (Warren et al., 2002), and the 50% mixture combines both snow and blue marine ice. The first column represents the wavelength in microns and the second column consists of the albedo values.
